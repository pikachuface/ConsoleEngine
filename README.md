# Framework for making Games in Console

## Specifications
The framework runs on [.NET Core 3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about) so if you would like to use it, you will need to [download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) the .NET Core. 

**These files are part of the framework:**
1. [Engine.cs](https://github.com/pikachuface/ConsoleEngine/blob/master/SnakeConsole/Engine.cs)
2. [GameObject.cs](https://github.com/pikachuface/ConsoleEngine/blob/master/SnakeConsole/GameObject.cs)
3. [Position.cs](https://github.com/pikachuface/ConsoleEngine/blob/master/SnakeConsole/Position.cs)
4. [CollisionBox.cs](https://github.com/pikachuface/ConsoleEngine/blob/master/SnakeConsole/CollisionBox.cs)

Rest is just for example.

## How to use
You will either need to make your own .dll from the files that are part of the framework or ~~Download it from release (only windows)~~.Then all you need to do is include the .dll with your binary.
